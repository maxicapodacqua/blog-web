It has been a tough month, but a beautiful year.

Bad things this month:

- I got some bad news about my job _(I got let go)_
- I'm not getting any severance package.

Good things:

- I have a solid group of friends and a wonderful family.
- [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) (my solutions [here](https://github.com/maxicapodacqua/advent-of-code))
- I get to plan what I'm going to do with my free time until I get a job.

## Getting let go from my job

I worked for the same company for over 10 years, I started at a very young age when the company was a start-up.
I joined as an intern and quickly I became a full part of the team. Now, I'm the oldest in the company (in terms of work experience), but also the only one on a work visa

Sadly, when companies get bigger, their people become smaller. Their goals are a reflection of the stock market and budget rather than long-term solutions that can change the market.

## My work status

Well, I will keep working until the end of December, so that's good I guess.
The ugly part is that, since I'm not a permanent resident of the USA, and because of my visa, I'm not allowed to have a job until I get a work permit (which is in progress).

Hopefully in the next months I will get my work permit and I could start my new journey in a new company with new coworkers, in the meantime I made a list
of things to do during my time off:

- Painting the house (I'm not a handy man at all, but why not trying)
- Finish my project "laburo" (will post about this at some point)
- Make more progress in Rust code
- Learn Elixir
- Help on some open source projects

## Support is key

Over the years I made tons of friends, giving them the bad news was hard, but the feedback and support I get from them is amazing. Calling my family was also tough, but it made me realize how important it is to keep connections alive (bad HTTP Joke, I know).

I don't think I'll struggle to get back on the work force, and I'm not saying it like "I'm the best developer ever", I'm saying that I will get the support that I need in any situation. That's all that matters, I can't expect every job to be perfect, or be perfect for ever, I can't live in an illusion of a job that will fulfill every aspect of life.

If there is anything you can take from this article is that having the job of your dreams is a blessing, and keeping it can be hard. But change is something you can always get back to.
