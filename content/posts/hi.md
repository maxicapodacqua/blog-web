So, this is my first time writing a blog post (ever).

I'm not sure what to expected from this, but I hope it becomes a fun experiment.

I'm running this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), deployed on Firbase. This is basically
a static generated website. No need for a database or anything fancy at the moment.

Currently, I find myself practicing algorithms and getting ready for this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), very excited to see
if I can pass day 8 this year.

Anyways, it's getting late and I have to figure out how to deploy this.
